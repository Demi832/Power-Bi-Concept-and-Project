Transformation
Removed irrelevant and blank columns
Made use of split column to simplify columns with "other" answer to make the data more usable

When given salary range
Duplicated Yearly Salary column and split column by digit to non digit, then find and replace k, - to nothing to get only numeric values + to 225 for same as avg
created a new column with add column and simple added the upper and lower values gotten from range and divided by 2
